# 📱 STUDENT QR CODE ATTENDANCE SYSTEM

A **Flutter-based mobile application** designed to **simplify the student attendance process** while **preventing cheating and proxy attendance**. The system uses **QR code verification and student signature confirmation** to ensure that attendance is recorded **accurately, securely, and transparently**.

This project is ideal for **universities, colleges, and schools** where class representatives (CRs) or lecturers manage attendance.

## 🚀 Key Objectives

- ✅ Simplify the attendance-taking process
- ❌ Prevent students from signing attendance on behalf of others
- 🔐 Improve attendance authenticity and accountability
- ⏱ Save time compared to manual attendance sheets
- 📊 Provide organized and printable attendance records

---

## 🧠 How the System Works

1. The **Class Representative (CR)** manages attendance sessions
2. A **QR Code** is generated for a specific session
3. Students **scan the QR Code**
4. Students must **add their own signature** to confirm presence
5. The system **detects and prevents cheating attempts** (proxy attendance)
6. Attendance is stored and can be **filtered, reviewed, and printed**
